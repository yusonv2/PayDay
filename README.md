# CA472 template repo

This is a template for CA472 projects.

## 1. Create your repo

One person from your project team should fork this repo, then add other teammates as project members on GitLab.

## 2. Name your repo appropriately

The name of your project must be of the form `2020-ca472-XXXXXXX`, where "`XXXXXXX`"
should be replaced with your usernames (e.g. `2020-ca472-ghealy-pclark-sblott`).

It is the *name of your repo* which matters (not the name of your project).

You can change the name of your repo on GitLab under:

- Settings / General / Advanced / Change path

It looks like this:

![change-repo-path](./res/repo-change-path.png "Change repo path.")

You should replace all of this file with a README describing your own project.
